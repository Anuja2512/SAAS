# PokeDoc
## *ACM's WCE Hackathon project named PokeDoc-Your Pocket Doctor by SAAS Team.*


### PokeDoc - The Pocket Doctor
The central idea of our project is to provide a simple interface for interactions between a doctor and patients. It also focuses on giving a single interface for all the health care needs of an individual while providing easy access of patient's information to the doctor. This information compromises his daily nutritions, his reports as well as prescriptions.

### Description:

In this application there are two modules: 
- Patient
-  Doctor

### Patient:
- Login with your personal account.
- Add daily Nutrition.
- Counts calories, proteins and carbohydrates.
- Can chat with the doctor.
- View and download Reports and Prescriptions.
- Can edit user information using Settings.

### Doctor:
- Add and Delete Patients.
- View Patient Nutrition Chart.
- Suggest through Chat.
- Add Prescription and view Report.
- Can edit user information using Settings.

### Uniqueness:

Most applications focus on providing immediate access from a list of registered doctors. However, PokeDoc focuses on providing the same immediate access but to a doctor who already knows the patient's various conditions and is trusted by the patient as well. The quick access to the patient's nutrition values will help the doctors in providing the best possible result for the patient.
